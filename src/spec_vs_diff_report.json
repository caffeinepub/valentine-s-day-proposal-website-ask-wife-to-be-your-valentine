However, the diff does not show the required new pig image files being added under frontend/public/assets/generated, and two additional project metadata files were modified without being requested.",

      "requirement": "Add the user-provided pig plushie images as static assets under frontend/public/assets/generated and reference them from ValentineQuestionCard.tsx (do not hotlink external URLs at runtime).",
      "reason": "The code references five new /assets/generated/*.png paths, but the diff shows no added files (and no changes under frontend/public/assets/generated), so there is no evidence the required static assets were actually added to the repo.",
